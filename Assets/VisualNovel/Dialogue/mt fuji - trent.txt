12;Hey Misaki, it's me. Can we talk?;2
0;I'm in Japan right now.;3;Sad
12;I know, sorry for disrupting your trip. I've been thinking a lot about you recently. Do you have time to call?;4
0;(This was everything I had yearned for the past few months, a second chance to prove myself worthy of love, to reconnect with the first boy who truly made me feel pretty.);5
0;(A shot at the future I so highly anticipated, one where Trent and I would wake up on Sundays in our underwear and kiss goodnight, one where we would learn, grow, and love together.);6
0;(But breaking up with someone is a commitment to throwing that future away, that no matter how much I loved him, he decided he could find someone better than I could ever be.);7
0;(Do I want to give myself another chance at heartbreak?);8
0;(I...);9,10
0;Don't call Trent.;11
0;Call Trent.;39
0;I don't have time. Sorry.;12
0;(I can't think about some boy when Summer and I are this tense.);13
0;Hey, Summer.;14
1;Hey.;15;Sad
0;Are you feeling okay?;16
1;I guess.;17
0;Do you want to talk about it?;18
1;Look, I was too hard on you. I'm sorry.;19
0;I'm sorry too. I know I went MIA when I started dating Trent, and you don't deserve to hear me talk about him all of the time.;20
1;I guess I've been frustrated about seeing our entire friend group have their futures figured out. I have no idea what I'm going to do.;21
0;I don't anyone knows what they're doing. If they do, then they're pretending.;22
1;I don't want us to fight.;23
0;I don't either. You're my best friend.;24;Happy
1;I'm sorry too about how negative I've been about Trent. I was invalidating your feelings.;25,26
0;Tell Summer about Trent's text.;27
0;Do not tell Summer about Trent's text.;37
0;Trent texted me, actually.;28
1;When? What did he say?;29
0;Just now. I think he wants to get back together.;30
1;That's good, right?;31;Happy
0;I'm starting to think I'm better off without him.;32
1;Really?;33
0;I don't want boys ruining our girls trip any longer. I'm sorry for how much I talked about him. I know it must've dragged the mood down.;34
1;Don't even worry about it.;35
0;If Trent really wanted to be with me, he wouldn't have broken up with me. I shouldn't go back to him just because we're both lonely.;36
1;I'm so proud of you.;-1
0;I'm sorry for bringing him up in the first place on our girls trip. No more relationship drama from now on, okay?;38
1;You got it.;-1;Happy
12;Hi.;40
0;Hey.;41
12;I know you're busy, so I promise to be fast. I'm sorry for the way things ended between us. The past couple of weeks, I've been thinking nonstop about you.;42
0;Right.;43
12;I regret us breaking up. I was stupid and frustrated, and it was wrong of me. I'm still crazy about you.;44
0;Really?;45
12;Of course. Would you be open to maybe talking again?;46,47
0;Yeah, okay. Maybe.;48
0;I'm sorry, but I really need to just focus on myself.;52
12;Thank you for being so understanding.;49
0;I should go.;50
12;Right, yeah, sorry again. I'll text you after your trip, okay?;51
0;Okay.;-1
12;Can you at least think about it?;53
0;We're not going to get back together.;54
12;I'm sorry, Misaki.;55
0;I should go.;56
12;Okay...Goodbye.;-1
