14;Can I have be seated for one?;4
0;Uh...yes? I can try to seat you.;5
1;And I can assist, I think.;6;Happy
14;Wow, both of you speak perfect English. In the US, we don't spend that much effort learning languages.;7
1;We are American.;8
14;That explains your accent. How long ago did you move to Japan?;9
1;We don't live in Japan.;10
14;I thought you worked here.;11,12
0;Tell her the truth.;13
0;Lie.;20
0;We're here on vacation and we got hungry. I think the sushi chef got us confused with his employees.;14
14;You are wearing the uniform.;15
1;Er, yes. I know it looks weird.;16
14;Maybe I should go to another restaurant?;17
1;This place had good reviews. I bet they make suitable sushi...not that I know.;18
14;I think...I will go somewhere else.;19
13;What are you two doing? Scaring away customers?;-1
0;We just got hired today, so Japan is still new to us. Here is your table.;21
14;What would you recommend?;22
1;I always get the California roll everywhere Iâ€”;23
0;She means omakase. That means the chef decides what you eat.;24
14;Okay, I guess I'll try that. I'm pretty new to sushi.;25
0;I'll let the chef know. Enjoy your stay in Japan.;26
1;What are you doing?;27
0;We're already wearing the aprons.;28
1;I've never worked at a restaurant in my life. Let alone one in Japan where I don't speak the language.;29
0;Maybe we'll get a meal out of this.;30
1;And here I thought you were against free labor.;-1
