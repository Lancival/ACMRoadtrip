1;Our trip is almost over. What was your favorite part?;2,3,4;HappyMakeover
0;Watching you try to serve Japanese customers at that sushi place.;5
0;Buying outfits together in Akihabara.;9
0;Eating at the maid restaurant.;7
1;Oh come on, your favorite part was seeing me suffer?;6
0;Well...;10;HappyMakeover
1;I thought you were miserable the whole time.;8
0;The whole situation was a little ridiculous but in a good way.;10
1;I told you we'd look badass.;10
0;(I looked out the window to see the greenery pass me, the stillness of the countryside.);11
0;(There is still a part of me that longs for what used to be, but perhaps I can still find joy within myself.);12
0;Summer?;13
1;Yeah?;14
0;Thanks for coming here with me. I love you, girl.;15
1;Aw, I love you too. I know things don't feel ideal now, but I'll always be there for you.;16
0;I've always been scared of people saying they were going to be there for me but then aren't. That came true when Trent and I broke up, and I just wanted to say that I appreciate you sticking by me, even when I can be a lot.;17
1;I...I need to tell you something.;18
0;What?;19
1;Promise not to hate me but I have a blind date for you when we get home.;20,21
0;WHAT?;22
0;Absolutely not. I'm not going.;24
1;He's cute for a straight man. You'd think so too.;23
0;How do you even know him?;26
1;You just said you loved me, so do this for me, okay?;25
0;I take it back.;26;Mad
1;This guy was flyering on campus for his comedy club, and I was like, 'Misaki's next guy should be funny,' 'cause no offense, Trent wasn't particularly hilarious—;27
0;Seriously?;28
1;So I decided to show him a picture of you—;29
0;I'm going to kill you.;30
1;And he said you were cute!;31
0;You don't even know him?;32
1;We got dinner. Platonic, obviously.;33
0;"Obviously" —— you don't even like men.;34;Happy
1;He was really nice! But that's all I can say.;35
0;And you've been keeping this from me?;36
1;I tried to tell you, but you spent the first half of the trip moping about Trent, so I figured it was bad timing.;37
0;What does he look like?;38
1;I can't tell you. It's supposed to be a blind date, silly.;39
0;But he knows what I look like.;40
1;I had to convince him to go out with you somehow.;41,42
0;...You promise he's cute?;43
0;I don't want to go.;46
1;I swear on my life and that of my future children.;44
0;If you insist, then I'll meet your "friend.";45
1;We need to make sure you're looking in your prime. See, that's why we had to buy you that outfit in Akihabara...;-1
1;Think about it at least?;47
0;Fine, but you can't complain when I say no.;-1
