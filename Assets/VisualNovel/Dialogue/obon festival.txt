0;(I remember coming here as a kid with my grandparents. I didn't understand the festival's significance at the time - to honor your ancestors - but coming here now makes me long for Japan.);7
0;(I can't let Trent haunt me today. Our memories together will always be painful, but hating myself is exhausting. I have to escape my past.);8

1;It was never your fault.;10

0;I'm sure there'll be times where I miss him, but I want to find my own happiness, one that's not tied to anyone. This trip made me realize that...;13
0;Things don't feel quite right yet, but it's the trying, I think. That I'm trying to accept myself and the good that comes. I mean, why should I let my brain attack me?;14

1;I don't know, but you'll never find out unless you're here to see, right?;26
0;I guess we'll just have to see where life takes me.;27
1;Honestly? Fuck Trent. You're going to live a better life without him.;21,22
0;I'm going to live my life to the fullest. Starting with...;29,30
