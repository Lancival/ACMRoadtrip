1;Pinch me. We're about to be in Tokyo.;2;Happy
0;Everything looks so different from when I was a kid. The city lights are everywhere.;3;Happy
1;Look at my outfit. Do I look like I fit in?;4
0;I'm pretty sure everyone can tell we're Americans.;5
1;What's the giveaway?;6
0;First of all, we're speaking English.;7
1;...Right.;8
0;(Trent would've brought his skateboard here. He'd love to go around and whisk past the shops.);9;Sad
0;(No, he was the one who backed out. He did this to himself.);10
1;You should ask that boy out.;11
0;Huh?;12
1;I see you staring at him.;13
0;(I must have been dazing off when I was thinking about Trent.);14
0;I wasn't staring at him.;15;Mad
0;Do you think he's cute?;16
0;I don't know.;17
1;I dare you to ask him out.;18
0;I don't even know him.;19
1;This is your opportunity to then.;20,21
0;Ask him out.;22
0;Stay seated;72
0;This is so embarrassing.;23
1;So you'll do it?;24
0;...New breakup, new me, I guess.;25
1;Oh my god. I can't wait to witness this.;26
0;(Here goes nothing.);27
0;Hello.;28;Happy
2;Hello. Do you need me to move seats?;29
0;Um, no. I noticed you and you seem...cool.;30
2;Thank you.;31
0;Do you want to go on a date?;32
0;(This is the most awkward encounter I've ever had.);33;Mad
0;(If there were a time the train should crash, now is as good as it's going to get.);34
0;(He's blushing! Oh my god, he's thinking about it.);35;Happy
2;I have a girlfriend.;36
0;(I can never show my face again.);37;Sad
0;Forget I even asked. Have a good day.;38
0;(I regret my existence.);39
1;So? How did it go?;40,41
0;He gave me his number.;42
0;It was a disaster.;45
1;Seriously?;43
0;Yeah, he also asked for my hand in marriage.;44;Mad
1;Oh.;46;Sad
1;Personally, I found him ugly.;46
0;He has a girlfriend.;47
1;It's okay! He's one fish in the sea. A stupid, useless fish at that!;48
0;(Everyone in this train is looking at us.);49
0;I'm never making a move again.;50;Sad
1;So he had a girlfriend. That was kind of thrilling, right?;51,52;Happy
0;It was...;53
0;I'm destined for singledom.;57
1;I told you! Now imagine the thrill when they say yes.;54
0;I'm imagining, but I'm coming up with a blank here.;55
1;Imagine harder.;56
0;It's hard to when...Trent.;59
1;If everyone in the world had to vote someone in their life who was destined to be single, you'd get zero votes.;58
0;I bet I'm who Trent would vote for.;59
1;Look, I get it. You remember how heartbroken I was when Rachel and I broke up. But once I was finally able to accept that I was still okay was when everything started falling into place.;60
0;Like what?;61
1;I realized I had the opportunity to be whoever I wanted to be. I could be spontaneous, say yes to everything.;62
0;Some people never fall in love. What if Trent was my one shot at something real, and now I've lost it?;63
1;A guy who breaks up with you over text is not your soulmate. I am the prime example that you can still be happy without your ex.;64,65
0;How did you get over that initial hurdle?;66
0;Why haven't you found someone new?;70
1;I thought that us breaking up was a reflection of my own flaws as a person and not the flaws of our compatibility.;67
1;She was an overachiever, and you know me. I'm not exactly a "school" person. That was a huge contention between us, and I was fixated that I wasn't smart enough.;68
0;He used to talk about how lucky he was to be with me.;69
1;Anyone would still be lucky. Don't forget that, okay?;-1
1;I had to do a lot of growth after our relationship. She was an overachiever, and you know me. I'm not exactly a "school" person.;71
1;That was a huge contention between us, and I was fixated that I wasn't smart enough for a long time. I'm still working on it.;-1;Sad
0;I can't.;73
1;You know, I got it. You stay here.;74;Happy
18;(Summer gets up from her seat and approaches the guy.);75
0;What are you doing?;76;Mad
0;(I can't watch.);77
0;(I have to watch.);78
0;(Why is she pointing at me?);79
18;(Summer smiles at him for a few minutes, then walks back);80
1;Damn.;81
0;Well? What happened?;82
1;It's okay. He wasn't even that cute.;83;Mad
0;What did you do?;84
1;I did what any good best friend does. I wing—womaned you.;85,86
0;You're the worst.;87
0;Thank you?;88
1;Hey! This could've been your true love.;89;Happy
1;Don't thank me. It didn't work out.;89
0;What happened?;90
1;I went over to him and asked if he thought you were cute. But then he said he had a girlfriend...;91;Sad
0;WHAT?;92
1;Right? I wish boys had signs on them like, I—am—taken, I—am—single, I—am—gay, so we know. Damn shame.;93
0;Not that, I mean why did you do that?;94
1;It's not healthy to hold on. You don't actually have to date anyone here, but you can look.;95
0;How did you even ask him? You don't speak the language.;96
1;Google Translate, silly. Don't worry, I told him you could speak Japanese.;97;Happy
0;I can't show my face on this train again.;98
1;We have to take the train every day on this trip.;99
0;So you finally looked at the itinerary?;100
1;Stop trying to change the subject. Next time, you're going up to the person.;101,102
0;That's way too embarrassing.;103
0;...Maybe.;107
1;Name one embararssing thing about it.;104
0;It was embarrassing when you did it.;105
1;Dating is an inherently embarrassing process.;106
0;I don't want to think about anyone else when...Trent.;59;Sad
0;But only if you promise to stop being my wing—woman.;108;Happy
1;Deal.;109
0;It's just hard right now when...Trent.;59
1;Tokyo, I am inside you.;60;Happy
18; (Summer slowly spins in a circle and giggles.);61
0;Summer...?;62;Happy
1;I'm having a moment. Let me have this.;63
0;...;64
1;Come on, can't you be a little excited?;65,66
0;I'll be excited once we find somewhere to eat.;67
0;TOKYO! I AM. INSIDE. YOU.;68
1;Let's explore and we can pick a place that sounds interesting. It'll be an adventure.;69
1;That's more like it.;69
0;I'm obsessed your pink hair. Did you dye it for the trip?;70
1;Er, no. I've had it for a while.;71
0;Why didn't you tell me you were going to dye it?;72
1;I did but you didn't respond. You were on a date with Trent.;73
0;Oh, sorry.;74;Sad
1;Oh my god. Is that..?;75
0;What are you looking at?;76
1;I found the perfect place for us to eat, but you're going to hate it.;77
0;I'm starving. I could eat anywhere.;78
1;There's a maid cafe down the street.;79
0;No.;80
1;Yes.;81
0;Only weird, single men go to those.;82;Mad
1;And soon, us.;83
0;That doesn't comfort me.;84
1;Please, for me?;85
0;Fine, but you're paying.;-1;Mad
