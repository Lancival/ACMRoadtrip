0;Sorry this was so last minute. I really thought Trent was going to come.;2;Sad
1;Don't even think about him. This is a girl's trip now.;3,4;Happy
0;You're right. I haven't visited Japan since I was a kid. This is supposed to be fun.;5;Happy
0;...Do you think he's thinking about me?;11
1;Maybe you'll find a hot Japanese man.;6
0;I thought you said this was a no boys trip.;7
1;I can make an exception.;8
0;I have subpar Japanese skills.;9
1;A lot of them know English! Even better, they can learn it for you.;10
0;Have you looked over the itinerary?;16
1;You're the best he's ever going to get, so I hope so.;12
0;That's not true.;13;Sad
1;You're pretty and smart and he's...?;14
0;Whatever. I'm going to focus on the trip.;15;Happy
1;That's the spirit.;10
1;I don't do those.;17
0;We're on a tight schedule if we want to make it to the Obon festival on time.;18
1;We'll be fine. It's almost the end of summer break — this is our time to be spontaneous.;19
0;Yeah, and I'm ending it single.;20;Sad
1;Meaning you can find a new, sexier, better person.;21,22
0;I can't stop thinking about Trent.;23
0;Who's going to want me?;25
1;I get that breakups are bad. Flaming piles of garbage bad. But we're in Japan! By the end of this trip, you'll be like "Trent, who?";24
0;You're right. I'm just having trouble moving on.;26;Happy
1;The opinion of a random boy is not worth you sacrificing your self—worth.;24
1;I'm sorry the timing was so rough.;27;Sad
0;I feel like we were together for so long that part of myself became him. I don't know who I am outside of us.;28;Sad
1;Then reinvent yourself. Who knows? Maybe you'll become like me.;29;Happy
0;...I really don't see that happening.;30
1;Just kidding. You don't want to be like me.;31
0;What do you mean?;32
1;I'm the pretty one and you're the smart one. We can't both be pretty, and I'm not about to be smart.;33
0;You're ridiculous.;34;Happy
1;I'm just happy we get to spend this time together. We haven't talked in a long time.;35
0;Ugh, don't remind me. I was too obsessed over Trent.;36
1;—which is now a thing of the past, right?;37
0;Right...;38
1;You look tired. Are you having that nightmare again?;39
0;I swear it happens every night. I'm on this ship and I feel like I have to reach the island —— there's something important there, but I'm not sure what. The storms get me eventually.;40;Sad
1;Maybe you're just stressed. Better than dreaming about this than Trent, right?;-1
